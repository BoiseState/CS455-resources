You should complete the template below with your own words and rename it as README.md. This
is a Markdown format file. If you are not familiar with it, here is a quick cheatsheet
[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]

## Overview

One line description of the homework and what parts you are attempting.

## Building the code

This section should tell the user how to build your code (if the homework involves code).  If you
are delivering a library or a jar file, where does it need to be installed or how do we use it?

## Testing

This section should describe how you tested your code (if relevant).  For a homework, I don't
expect much but this section should have some content.  List known bugs that you weren't able
to fix (or ran out of time to fix).


## Reflection

What problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your own? What kinds of
errors did you get? How did you fix them?  Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in
the process of working on this homework?

This is the juicy part for me :-)
