/**
 * Used to launch a server from <code>inetd</code>.  The <code>main</code>
 * method of this server implementation exports the service object (an
 * instance of <code>ServiceInterface</code>) and then uses the utility
 * method <code>InitializeRegistry.initializeWithInheritedChannel</code> to
 * create and export a registry using an inherited channel (if any) and
 * to bind a name to the service proxy in that registry for clients to look
 * up.
 *
 * <p>This program, when configured to be started from <code>inetd</code>,
 * will start the server when a client attempts to look up the server by
 * name in the registry on the port configured with <code>inetd</code>.
 *
 * <p>To configure <code>inetd</code> to launch this program, the following
 * entry should be added to the configuration file
 * <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    example-server stream tcp wait nobody <b><i>jrehome</i></b>/bin/java \
 *	  java -classpath <b><i>classpath</i></b> example.inetd.RMIDateServer
 * </pre>
 * where <b><i>jrehome</i></b> is the path to the installed JRE, and 
 * <b><i>classpath</i></b> is the class path for the example.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the <code>example-server</code> name needs to be
 * configured as a service in the <code>/etc/services</code> file as
 * follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    example-server    <b><i>port</i></b>/tcp
 * </pre>
 * where <b><i>port</i></b> is the port the registry will accept requests
 * on.  Note that the service name--
 * here we used <code>example-server</code>-- can be another name, as long
 * as the chosen name it is not already configured in /etc/services.
 *
 * <p>This program also supports being run from the command line.  In this
 * case, there is no inherited channel, and the program will simply
 * create/export a remote service, create/export a registry on the port
 * number supplied as the command line argument, and then bind the
 * service's proxy in the registry for clients to look up.

 * <p>This program can be run from the command line as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     java example.inetd.RMIDateServer <b><i>port</i></b>
 * </pre>
 * where <b><i>port</i></b> is a nonzero port that the registry accepts
 * requests on.
