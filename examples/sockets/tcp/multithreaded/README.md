Go up two levels in the folder hierachy.

cd ../..

Running the server:

	java tcp.multithreaded.TimeServer  <port>

Running the client (on same or another machine):

	java tcp.multithreaded.TimeClient <hostname> <port>

Use localhost for hostname and 5005 for port.


Use the test.sh script to launch multiple clients in parallel!
