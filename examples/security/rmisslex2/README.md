Change to subdirectory resources/ to do Steps 1-5. Use password test123 (as it is embedded in the server and client code).

1. 	Generate a keystore that has a key pair (public and private key) along with a
	self-signed certificate. (PKCS12 is an industry standard store type)

	keytool -deststoretype pkcs12 -genkey -alias SecureServer -keyalg RSA -keystore Server_Keystore

2. 	Examine the contents of the generated Server Keystore

	keytool -list -v  -keystore Server_Keystore

3.  Create a self-signed certificate.

	keytool -export -alias SecureServer -keystore Server_Keystore -rfc -file Server.cer

4. 	To see what the certificate looks like.

	cat Server.cer

5.  Next we import the server certificate into a truststore that can be used by
    the client. Set the same password test123 (as it is embedded in the client
	code as well)

	keytool -import -alias SecureServer -file Server.cer -keystore Client_Truststore

6.	To verify the contents of the truststore that we created, we issue
	the following command. The contents of the truststore should
	contain a trustedCertEntry, which means that a private key is
	not available and should not be.

	keytool -list -v  -keystore Client_Truststore

In our example, we are working with a self-signed certificate instead of certificates signed by
Certification Authority (CA). If there is a need to get the certificate signed by a CA then a
Certificate Signing Request(CSR) needs to be generated. The generated CSR, then, should to be
submitted along with other pertinent information to a Certification Authority such as VeriSign
or USPS, who will then digitally sign the certificate.

Usng with MongoDB or other fraemworks that also use SSL
=======================================================
Use the keytool to import our self-signed certificate into a copy of the default truststore,
located in $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts. Then we can rename this (or not) and use it for our
own truststore on the client and server. Because it includes all the default certs, it doesn't
break Mongo's security.


#To run the server:
Change back to the top level examples/security directory to run the example.  

cd ..

Start the RMI registry using one of your assigned ports (and set the CLASSPATH so it can find the
classes)

export CLASSPATH=$(pwd):$CLASSPATH
rmiregistry <registryPort>

The start the server using the same registryPort as an argument:

java rmisslex2.server.SquareServer <registryPort> &


#To run the client:

java rmisslex2.client.SquareClient  localhost <value> <numcalls> <registryPort>


To see all the network transmissions, try

java -Djavax.net.debug=all rmisslex2.client.SquareClient localhost
