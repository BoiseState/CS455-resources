JFLAGS=

# Recognize files with .class and .java extensions
.SUFFIXES: .class .java

# This is a rule to convert a file with .java extension
# into a file with a .class extension. The macro $< just
# supplies the name of the file (without the extension) 
# that invoked this rule.

.java.class:
	javac $(JFLAGS) $<

all: compile 


# To satisfy the rule named compile, we must have the  following 
# class files (with date no later than the source .java files).
# We also must have satisfied the rule named doc.

compile: GetAllNetworkInterfaces.class PrintNetworkInterfaces.class\
		PrintMulticastParameters.class

# Run javadoc on all hava source files in this directory.
# This rule depends upon the rule named html, which makes the
# html directory if does not already exist.

doc: html
	javadoc -private -author -version -d html/ *.java

# Make the html subdirectory.
html:
	mkdir html
