The main class is the time.Controller class.  There are no command line
arguments.

"java time.Controller" should work fine.

Running this app spawns a client and a server thread.  It also presents the
user with a message to press enter.  Every time the user press enters it
causes every client to report to every server their current time.

Their is one multicast address of 230.230.230.230.  The server listens on 5800
and the client listens on 5801.

For testing, the application assumes there is only one NIC - therefore it
does not work in it's current state from onyx.  However, it does work great on
node00 - node32.  There are some options to pick an interface, but no time for
me to implement.

It seems to work great.  I tested with a maximum of 5 nodes, but don't see any
scaling issues.  I don't exit the multicast groups gracefully.  

There is a Makefile and a javadoc that work.
