The main class is the time.Controller class.  There are no command line
arguments. Simply run the following on each participating node:

	java time.Controller

Running this program spawns a client and a server thread.  It also presents the
user with a message to press enter.  Every time the user press enters it
causes every client to report to every server their current time.

Their is one multicast address that is used: 230.230.230.230.  The server listens on 5800
and the client listens on 5801.

For testing, the application assumes there is only one NIC - therefore it
does not work in it's current state from onyx.  However, it does work great on
node00 - node32.  There are some options to pick an interface, but no time for
me to implement.

It seems to work great.  I tested with a maximum of 5 nodes, but don't see any
scaling issues.  I don't exit the multicast groups gracefully.
