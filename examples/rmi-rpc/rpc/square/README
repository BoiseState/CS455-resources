If you start the server and see the following error:

$ ./server 
Cannot register service: RPC: Authentication error; why = Client credential too weak
unable to register (SQUARE_PROG, SQUARE_VERS, udp).[amit@kohinoor square]: 
$

then add the following line to /etc/sysconfig/rpcbind

RPCBIND_ARGS=-i

and then restart the rpcbind service

/sbin/service rpcbind restart



The client_test.c program makes n calls to the RPC for timing purposes.
