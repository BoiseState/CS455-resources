The example LoadClient.java loads an object dynamically over the Internet.
It assumes that the object MyClient (compiled class in bytecode format)
lives on an accessible directory on another host that has a httpd server
running on it. Try it out as follows:

java LoadClient http://onyx.boisestate.edu/~amit/rmi/ex4/ 

The class MyClient.class lives on onyx under ~amit/public_html/rmi/ex4/ (don't
forget to add the trailing slash).
