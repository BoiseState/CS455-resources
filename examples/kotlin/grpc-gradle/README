To compile into a fat JAR, use this command:

$ gradlew buildFatJar

To run the test suite, use this command

$ gradlew test

To generate a key pair and a certificate, use these commands. The second command is for translating
the key to a specific format so Netty can use it.
$ openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in mykey.pem -out mykey.pem.pkcs8
$ openssl req -new -x509 -key mykey.pem -out certificate.cer -days 1825 -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:localhost"
