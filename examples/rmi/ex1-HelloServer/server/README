To compile:

javac *.java
rmic HelloServer

or use just say

make


To run:

Start up the registry on the server

rmiregistry <port>

The default port is 1099. That is used if the registry is being shared by
various servers. Otherwise start up a private copy of the registry using
our own assigned port.


Then start the server with the appropriate security policy:

java -Djava.security.policy=mysecurity.policy HelloServer &

Wait for ready message from the server before running the client.


If you compiled the server in a package, then provide appropriate classpath
and rmi codebase VM arguments.

java -classpath classDir -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:classDir/ -Djava.security.policy=mysecurity.policy HelloServer &
