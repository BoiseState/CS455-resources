Make sure you build the server first as the client needs HelloServer_Stub
class from the server side.

To compile:

make

To run:

The rmiregistry and server should be already running. Then use

java HelloClient hostname [registryPort]

The registryPort is only needed if registry is running on a port other than 1099.


If you compiled the client in a package, the provide the appropriate class
path.

java  -classpath classDir  <package specifier>.HelloClient
