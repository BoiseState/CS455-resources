Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) examples
============================================

To compile all the RMI examples, run make in this top-level folder. Or open each example subfolder as a
separate project in Eclipse or other IDEs. Read the appropriate README.md file in each example subfolder
for instructions on how to run that particular example.
