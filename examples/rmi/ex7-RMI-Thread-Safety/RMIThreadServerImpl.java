/** Implementation of the RMIThreadServer interface for RMI.  
    Change the read() and update() functions from synchronized to
    unsynchronized to watch how you can create race conditions and
    clobber data using RMI threads.

    How it works: We have a global variable ("counter"), which is incremented
    then decremented by a call to update().  This should appear atomic to
    clients, but if there are multiple clients connecting simultaneously, each
    client potentially could read the variable at any stage when another
    thread is executing the update() method.  By synchronizing both the
    read() and update() methods, only one client is allowed to execute those
    methods at a time.  The result is that each client sees counter==0, both
    before and after executing the update() method.
