This is a modification of ex1 and demonstrates how setup a timeout for a RMI call.
--------

To compile client and server:

make

To run:

Start up the registry on the server.

export CLASSPATH=`pwd`:$CLASSPATH
rmiregistry <port>

The default port is 1099. That is used if the registry is being shared by various
servers. Otherwise start up a private copy of the registry using our own assigned port.


Then start the server with the appropriate security policy:

java -Djava.security.policy=mysecurity.policy hello.server.HelloServer &

Wait for ready message from the server before running the client. To run the
client, use:


java hello.client.HelloClient hostname [registryPort]

The registryPort is only needed if registry is running on a port other than 1099.

If you compiled the server in a package, then provide appropriate classpath in the RMI codebase
VM argument. This assumes that server class files are in a folder that is accessible via a web
server (running on the same system where the RMI server will run)

java -classpath classDir -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:classDir/ -Djava.security.policy=mysecurity.policy HelloServer &
