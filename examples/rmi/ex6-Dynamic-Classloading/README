The rmi example is setup to run on onyx.boisestate.edu. The server side code can be found
in http://onyx.boisestate.edu/~amit/rmi/ex6-Dynamic-Classloading/. The client side code can be
found at http://cs.boisestate.edu/~amit/teaching/455/rmi/ex6-Dynamic-Classloading/.

The firewall on onyx needs to allow RMI traffic from cs and vice versa (for call backs).
