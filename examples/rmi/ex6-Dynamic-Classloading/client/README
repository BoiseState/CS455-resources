The rmi example is setup to run on onyx.boisestate.edu. The code can be found
in http://onyx.boisestate.edu/~amit/rmi/ex6/

Use the script runServer to run the server on onyx. Then on your local
machine, use the script runClient to run the client. Your local machine must
have a web server running and this directory must be accessible via the web.

Note that the client doesn't need MyServer_Stub class!
