The rmi example is setup to run on onyx.boisestate.edu. The code can be found
in http://onyx.boisestate.edu/~amit/rmi/ex6-Dynamic-Classloading/

Use the script run-server.sh to run the server on onyx. Then on your local
machine, use the script run-client.sh to run the client. Your local machine must
have a web server running and this directory must be accessible via the web.
