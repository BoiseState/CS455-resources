IDE Notes
=========

The repository consists of multiple projects instead of the more typical one project per repository
style that you may be more use to from the past. Some of the top-level folders are projects and some
contain several projects in it (except for the `other-languages` subfolder)

For example, create a new Java project in your IDE and point the working folder to the
`sockets` folder to run all the sockets examples.

The following folders are projects: threads, sockets, lambdas, reflection, serialization, java-service,

the following folders cntain sunfolders, each of which is a project: rmi, multicasting, security,
misc.

Eclipse notes
=============
Use Eclipse style file provided here (Amit-Eclipse-style.xml) in your Eclipse to
get same formatting as I use.
