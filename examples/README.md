IDE Notes
=========

The repository consists of multiple projects instead of the more typical one project per repository
style that you may be more use to from the past. Each of the top-level folder is a Java project
(except for the `other-languages` subfolder)

For example, create a new Java project in your IDE and point the working folder to the
`sockets` folder to run all the sockets examples.

Eclipse notes
=============
Use Eclipse style file provided here (Amit-Eclipse-style.xml) in your Eclipse to
get same formatting as I use.
